We also believe our customers are of prime importance and do our best to make sure they face no issues while using our services, providing them with the best services possible by our team.</li>
<li class="pb-10">The pivotal purpose of our Grievance Redressal Policy, in accordance to Rule 5 (9) of the IT Rules, 2011, is to reduce all the situations that may arise leading to our customers getting dissatisfied with our services and complaints against the same. The policy also aims at a better use of our review mechanism, ultimately ensuring that you get what you asked for without any hassles and making adequate redressals and even initiating refunds if there is a need to do so.</li>
<li class="pb-10">Digisignature.org. Grievance Redressal (and Refund) Policy is based on the core principle:
Customers must always be treated fairly.
Customers are fully informed of avenues to escalate their complaints / grievances within the organization and their rights to alternative remedy
In cases where redressal is not possible, refund of the amount paid by the customer at the earliest
</li>
<li class="pb-10">The policy document is available on the Digisignature.org website i.e. www.Digisignature.org

</li>
</ul>
<strong> What Is A Complaint?</strong>
<p class="pb-10">A complaint can be defined as a dissatisfaction a customer is facing, expressed in person, in writing or over a call, regarding a mishap, mismanagement or any other error in the services provided to them, or against the way in which their complaints are addressed. When a customer comes with a complaint, they expect a corrective measure against the concerned mishap that is the reason behind their dissatisfacion.</p>
<strong> What Is A Query?</strong>
<p class="pb-10" >Query can be defined as a doubt, confusion or a question a customer may have regarding the services provided to them. This may not arise out of any dissatisfaction. Queries are often in the form of an enquiry or a request made to concerned executives, for which proper guidance or relevant information is expected in return. When it comes to handling queries, the service provider also expects a decent clarification and/or relevant data that would help them solve the issue effectively.</p>
